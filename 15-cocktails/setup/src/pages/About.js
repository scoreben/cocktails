        The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ),
        was a socialist state that spanned Eurasia during its existence from 1922 to 1991.
        It was nominally a federal union of multiple national republics; in practice
        its government and economy were highly centralized until its final years.
